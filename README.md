## Assigment 1 Anscombes DataSet Analysis

### Overview/Objective
This objective of this assignment is to use the Anscombe Data Set to demonstrate the necessity to present both descriptive statistics and plots/visualisations of data. The assignment also demonstrates the use of various packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and The Seaborn package for both creation of summary statistics and visualisation of data sets. 

### Layout
The assignment is divided into 4 sections: 
    1. Background to the Data set
    2. Plots of Interesting Aspects of the Data Set
    3. Descriptive Statistics
    4. Discussion of Statistics and their Visualisation
    
**Background to the dataset** 
Describes the author, his paper and the rationale behind the data set.

**Plots of Interesting aspects of the dataset** 
Uses *pandas* to read in the Data Set from a csv file, *Numpy* to split the Data Set into its quartets and then create individual scatter plots of each quartet using the *pyplot* sub library of *matplotlib*.

Subplots of the DataSet were also displyed in order to demonstrate how subplots could be displayed side by side.

**Descriptive Statistics**
Summary statistics of the DataSet and its quartets were then created using the *.describe()* function of the Pandas Library.

The Pearson correlation coefficient and *p* values for each quartet were then displayed in order to show the relationship between the x and y values. 

The next section uses the *Seaborn* Package to display graphs, linear regression equations and R^2 values for each quartet.

**Discussion of Statistics and their Visualisation**

Here the Dataset is discussed from the perspective of having both summary statistics and visualisations of the data generated.
